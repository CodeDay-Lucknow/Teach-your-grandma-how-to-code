# IMPERITIVE PROGRAMMING is probably the easiest of all programming.
# Think of your programming language as a REALLY BIG SMART calculator
# That's all it is.

print("Hello world!") # Do this
32 + 12               # Then do this
x = 2 + 2             # Then this
print(x)              # Finally, this


# Basically running commands in sequence. Pretty easy, right?
# It's like a cooking recipe. You just give simple instructions and stuff happens.

# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# xPoints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# yPoints = [12, 23, 10, 9, 5, 23, 12, 6, 1, 18]

# plt.plot(xPoints, yPoints)
# plt.show()
